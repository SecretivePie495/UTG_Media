      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">7. No Warranties</h2>
      <p class="italic text-gray-300">
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Services are provided “as is” and “as available,”
        without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory.
      </p>
      <p>
        We specifically disclaim any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
        purpose, non-infringement, and any warranties arising out of course of dealing or usage of trade.
        We do not warrant that the website will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free, or that any
        defects will be corrected.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event will UTG.AI, its owners, affiliates,
        officers, employees, or partners be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential,
        or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly,
        or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2 md:ml-5">
        <li>Your access to or use of, or inability to access or use, the Services.</li>
        <li>Any conduct or content of any third party.</li>
        <li>Unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Where our liability cannot be excluded under applicable law, our total aggregate liability arising
        out of or relating to the Services or these Terms will be limited to the amount you paid us (if any)
        for the Services giving rise to the claim during the 3 months before the event giving rise to the claim.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">9. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless UTG.AI and its owners, affiliates, officers,
        employees, and partners from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses,
        including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of or in any way connected with:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2 md:ml-5">
        <li>Your use of the Services.</li>
        <li>Your violation of these Terms.</li>
        <li>Your violation of any applicable law or any third-party rights.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">10. Changes to the Services & Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update or modify the Services at any time, including adding or removing features.
        We may also update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will revise the “Last
        updated” date above and may provide additional notice where required by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your continued use of the Services after the updated Terms become effective means you
        accept the changes.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">11. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction
        in which UTG.AI primarily operates, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
        Any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services will be subject to
        the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that jurisdiction, where permitted by law.
