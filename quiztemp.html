Now I only have twelve hundred followers on Instagram. I'm not a celebrity. I don't send any cold emails, but I've done over two million in total revenue from my agency in the last few years.\n\nAnd I was able to do this because of one single marketing channel, Meta Ads. More specifically running Meta Ads to a front end profitable funnel, which gets gets us a ten x return on the back end. Now I call this the LTV funnel. My name is Udo Onyekwere.\n\nAnd just so you know that I've actually done what I'm talking about, I started my ecom focused marketing agency called UTG Media back in twenty twenty three. I'm being completely honest with you here. I struggled to grow this business at first. It took me two years just to hit a five hundred k a year run rate as you can see here.\n\nStarted, you know, start of Jan, twenty twenty three, and then this is October twenty twenty four. Even though I was working ten hours a day, posting on every single content platform, imaginable, pleading clients for referrals, and testing cold email endlessly. Now don't get me wrong. This growth wasn't bad.\n\nBut like you watching this, I got into business to make some serious money, and this just wasn't cutting it. So I wanted to grow faster. Now luckily, I had a discussion with a friend who was seeing success with paid ads for his agency at the time. Now this was weird to me.\n\nI was running paid ads for my clients, but I didn't know I was could run paid ads for myself to get clients. Right? And so I decided to go all in. And fast forward three months, I tripled my NRR from around fifty k where it was in October, all the way up to a hundred and fifty k in Jan twenty twenty five.\n\nAnd over\n\nthe course of the next twelve months, we went on to make around one point five million top line and build out a team of thirty people, full time at the agency in twenty twenty five as you can see here. Now if you're watching this and you're an agency only making around two hundred and fifty k a year, who sells a service that's at least two thousand dollars, then you're probably either in one or two camps right now.\n\nYou've not tried paid ads before. I'm guessing this is gonna be most of you, which means you're probably sending a lot of cold emails, or you're spending hours making content, and you feel more like an influencer than a business owner.\n\nOr you're relying on referrals and partnerships, which are obviously great when they pull through, but are always gonna be, you know, inconsistent. Right? And not scalable. So this is probably what business feels like.\n\nNow you might be doing way more revenue than this. I've spoken to agency owners that are doing three hundred and four hundred k a month, but they're still only doing organic, and they haven't even touched paid ads yet, which is just a huge opportunity. Now what might be holding you back from running paid ads is that you think they're expensive, difficult, or only for people doing millions of dollars a year. And you also probably think that if you do get meetings, they're gonna be unable to pay high ticket prices, impossible to close, or just angry at you and hate you for no reason.\n\nNow if you're in this position, I'm genuinely excited for you. Because what this means is that you have a validated service that people actually want, and you have cash flow, which are two things that are required to make paid ads work. And you also have probably a false belief about ads that I may get to break in today's video, which is pretty exciting. Now ad are an amplifier.\n\nSo if your business is good, they have the potential to skyrocket you into the stratosphere. I promise you trying to blow up on IG reels or, you know, have this super niche cold email strategy is just not the best way to scale. The top guys who are selling get leads through organic content offers are all making money with paid ads. And now don't get me wrong.\n\nI posted a of content here and there myself, but most of my money is made through paid ads. So don't even get me started on cold emails as well. The constant tech battles, the cool quality, the running out of leads, it's just not an efficient way to scale. Okay?\n\nAnd you're you're only scaling through referrals, then you've heard this before, you know, you're leaving millions on the table. You know you are. So clearly your product is good enough to get you referrals. So if you just built a machine that could get you new leads on command, you'd sell out.\n\nNow for ninety percent of you reading this, simply signing more clients will literally fix all of your problems in your agency. Imagine if you had eight to ten live, qualified, and purchase ready meetings on your calendar every single day. You'd probably be able to close one, three, or more of those every single day. Right?\n\nNow that is how a hundred k, two hundred and fifty k, and five hundred k months become completely inevitable. And in fact, any operational constraints could probably be solved by just hiring high level team members with the extra cash that you're making from all of these qualified calls. Plus, everyone's gonna want to work, for your agency because you're growing so fast.\n\nSo that's camp number one.\n\nCamp number two is that you have tried or you're actively trying to run paid ads. And my guess is if you're still watching this, then they may not be going how you want them to go. Your cost per call is probably way higher than you would like.\n\nYou're paying hundreds of dollars more than you would like to get a live qualified prospect to show. And the show rate's terrible. Forty to fifty percent no show rate, so you're paying literally hundreds more on top of that, per live call. And you may not even be tracking any of this properly.\n\nYou may not know your show rates. You may not know your offer rates. You may not know your click through rates all off the top of your head. And when these prospects do show, it's impossible to close them.\n\nThey're more skeptical. They need more nurturing, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. Meanwhile, your profit margins are getting squeezed. You're spending twenty, thirty, forty k a month on ads just to maintain and you're kind of on this this hamster wheel.\n\nAnd suddenly your forty, fifty, sixty percent margin agency is now a twenty five percent margin business and you feel like you don't even know what type of business you're running anymore. You know ads are supposed to work. You've seen other businesses scale with them, but for you, they're either bleeding money or barely boating even. Okay?\n\nAnd that is because paid ads need to be perfect. Your offer needs to be perfect. Your creative needs to be perfect. Your landing page needs to be perfect.\n\nVSL, prequel, sales process, sales process, fulfillment process. If any of these steps are out of whack, then the whole thing doesn't work. The unit economics do not add up. Now if you wanna avoid this situation, which being totally honest with you, I actually got myself into right at the start of my journey with paid ads, where every single time you increase spend, on profitability and operational stress increases with it, then keep watching.\n\nBecause\n\nif either of these situations sound familiar, then I hope what I'm about to show you will change your business forever. Because over the last year, after spending three hundred k on ads for my own agency and also consulting dozens of other agencies, I've put together a system that's specifically designed for agency owners, for paid ads that I call the LTV funnel, which you can see here. Now the LTV funnel is pretty simple. We basically wanna start with a cold traffic optimized offer because with cold traffic, people buy offers, they do not buy you.\n\nRight? And so the offer is the the front and center thing that will get you results, that will get you sales goal. The most common thing that I see with agencies messing up paid ads is that they do not have the offer and by extension the messaging properly configured. So they're spending all this time creating cool ad creatives and all this other stuff, but nothing is working.\n\nFurthermore, if you get the offer wrong, on the unit economic side, you know, you could have fantastic marketing. You get all this right, but the the whole thing still wouldn't work because the the economics don't work. Your CAC is too high, your LTV is too low, etcetera. Once we've nailed the culture of Copa, we obviously need to put a bit of money into the system.\n\nThen we put that money onto, attention grabbing assets, otherwise known as ads, And we wanna run a wide variety of ads. After Meta's Andromeda update, we see the, advertisers with the highest creative uniqueness and variation get the best results. So we're testing talking head ads, AI ads, b o ads, UGC ads, all of these different things. We're sending that traffic to a simple landing page, either a VSL or a straight up application page, which I actually recommend.\n\nWe're then qualifying them through a type form. We're disqualifying unqualified traffic, or we're sending that traffic to a page, thank you page without a schedule pixel on so as to not feed that data back to Meta. And then we can put them on a call with a setter. And, of course, the qualified traffic is going straight onto the calendar with you or your closing team.\n\nAnd then on, after that, we're basically putting through a very thorough pre call nurturing process with multiple emails a day, selfie videos, blue eye messages, content remarketing ads, all of those things. If you are not doing this, you will it will be very hard to make paid ads work because your show rates and your close rates would simply be too low. Our our job from the point of a call being booked is to nurture the hell out of these prospects and answer every single objection that they have so that they get on the call and they just hand you money. From there, we wanna see a certain offer rate, a certain close rate, and a certain day one AOV to make sure this whole thing works.\n\nWith the agency model, I like to try and prioritize for as much upfront cash as possible so that we can be profitable and we can just pocket that for ourselves, number one. And number two, so that we can reinvest back into ads, and achieve a process called client financed acquisition, which I'll talk about in a second here.\n\nNow from there, we get into the fulfillment piece. Now, course, if you're an info product, your job's pretty much done more or less once you've made the sale, because your product is just a course. Right? With an agency, it's a little more complex than that.\n\nYour fulfillment is people. Your fulfillment is a process. It's a journey. And so we wanna make sure that we frame a long term LTV in the onboarding sequence, and we also start to introduce our cross selling and upsell programs, which is why the eight the funnel is called the LTV funnel is because this is the advantage of an agency, which I'll get to in a second here.\n\nFrom there, we wanna go through the fulfillment processes so that we get a sub ten percent monthly churn rate. We also wanna obviously have a one to one account manager model, so it's scalable. So all of you watching this who are still deeply involved in fulfillment, we need to pull you out fulfillment if you wanna scale in this way.\n\nFurthermore, we then wanna go into, obviously upsell and cross selling. We wanna have at least one in three people that come through and buy from us, ascend or cross sell into some other products, and we wanna be achieving at a very minimum twenty to thirty thousand dollars in client lifetime value from this. Okay? And then this whole thing repeats again.\n\nNow in simple terms, this funnel has the potential to deliver you dozens of meetings per day with potential clients that are prequalified, presold, and able to pay you five to maybe even six figures in lifetime value. Now this is the advantage of an agency. Look, you may have some disadvantages. You have a capped team capacity, and you have higher operational costs than an info business, for example, or a coaching business.\n\nBut you have what other founders in the online business space could only dream of, which is the chance to have a twenty k, thirty k, or even a fifty thousand dollar client LTV from just one or two service lines. Okay? And as I said, if you just delivered one, two, or maximum, maybe three simple services with a lean team, smart cross sells, and a well thought out customer journey, you have a wealth building machine where you can pay one thousand, two thousand, three thousand dollars to literally buy a customer, and then have that customer pay you twenty, thirty, fifty thousand dollars or more over the next few months.\n\nSo you can literally get a ten x return on ad spend. You know, this is never gonna happen with some kind of info business because getting an LTV like that is so difficult. So if you haven't deployed the system into your business, you will be playing the agency game on hard mode in twenty twenty six. Cold email is getting less trustworthy.\n\nReferrals are harder to come by. Content is becoming more But if you run paid ads in the right way, that can literally never become saturated because you will just rise up over everyone else as you get cheaper CPMs and better CTRs, and you will just be able to spend more money than everyone else and scale. Especially if you have the client LTV in place, you'll always be able to outspend your competitors. You can control your client acquisition.\n\nYou can outspend your competition. You cannot out get views on Instagram. You cannot control how many views you get. You can't control how many followers you you get.\n\nOkay?\n\nSo this is the only system that will give you full control over your growth. The best targeting on the planet. Right?\n\nMeta will find your ICP. Everyone on the planet uses Instagram or Facebook. A predictable pipeline so that you're not dependent on referrals or content hitting and popping off and going viral. Scales without adding time.\n\nOkay? If you wanna scale your content, typically you've gotta increase your content output. If you wanna, you know, scale your networking, you've gotta go to more events. This scales without time adding time.\n\nYou just increase the ad spend. You simply press a button on your screen and you make more money. You control the positioning. You do not compete on price in a marketplace because you have full control over the offer, etcetera.\n\nAnd the beautiful thing of running an agency is is you can change your offer on a dime. If you're a SaaS business or e e commerce business, you can't do that.\n\nWe can just rework your offer at any given point, and we can then out position your competitors. We can prequalify prospects before you book. Imagine trying to get a cold email prospect to go through a form. They're not gonna do that.\n\nWith ads, they are putting their hand up and saying, hey, I'm interested. I'm going through your funnel. I'm applying through your form. That way when they get on the call, we have that point of leverage over them.\n\nWhy did you book a call? Why did you go through this this whole application form? You know, and you have all of these data points about them so that it's easier to close them. You're gonna reach thousands of people.\n\nThis is way more volume than you than you probably have with your warm traffic. Okay? You literally can reach hundreds of thousands of people with your ads at the click of a button. And finally, this is a system that's gonna attract very premium buyers.\n\nCold email does not do this. Cold outreach does not do this. Okay? Now best of all, you can take a tiny portion of your profits from running this system every single month and then reinvest them back into more ad spend.\n\nMeaning the whole system flywheels and gets better every single month.\n\nNow if you're thinking, okay, this all looks great, but how exactly do I create a culture after gopher with the right unit economics? Make good ad creatives that actually book meetings and don't just burn cash. Create a qualification form with the right conditional logic so that I can actually, disqualify unqualified people and and get qualified people onto the call.\n\nHow do I set this all up into the right media buying structure so that I can literally manage this whole thing in under ten minutes a day? How do I create a twenty plus step pre call nurturing flow which gets seventy percent plus show rate? How do I build out a scalable sales team, which gets me five, ten, or more, calls per day? And how do I give that to someone else, who can just close them as well or even better than I can so that you can get your time back?\n\nAnd how do you build a productized client fulfillment journey which gets sub ten percent monthly churn rates and reliably spits out a twenty k to fifty k client LTV?\n\nWell, let me explain our offer to you. This is the advertising intensive, and this can work on either a group one to one or done for you basis depending on how you would like to work with us. We're gonna go through cold traffic offer creation on a one to one onboarding call with myself.\n\nWe're gonna go through funnel creation. You can either copy our winning templates that we'll give to you that we've proven with over hundreds of thousands of ad spend this year, or you can have us build it out for you. Messaging creation, again, you can use our custom AI agents. By the way, we have genuine custom AI agents built out for every single step in this process.\n\nSo you can leverage those to get your messaging dialed in, or you can have us create it for you. VSL doc, you can, use again our agents to actually build you and write you a BSL script or a document, very, very quickly, and it's gonna be extremely good. Or again, you can have us write it for you. Ad scripts, same thing.\n\nWe can use our AI agent or we can actually write them for you using our in house copywriters. Video editing, same thing. You can use our editing SOPs so that you know exactly how you should be editing your video ads or again, we can do it for you. Email s s SMS sequences, we're gonna go through the same thing.\n\nPixel tracking setup, automation build out. We're launching the ad campaigns and then from there we're optimizing and scaling your ads. We are showing you the exact sales systems that you need to learn so that you can actually, build out setting team, sales teams. This part is only done with you, and with this is typically, taking place over weekly coaching, with directly myself.\n\nOkay? Either on a one to one or a group group capacity. Then fulfillment systems, again, same thing. This is gonna be something that I help you with, either one to one or in a group capacity to make sure that you have the right fulfillments, processes, the onboarding, the client journeys, everything that you need to get that high client LTV.\n\nAnd then finally from there, well, actually included in all that is weekly calls. Again, whether it's a group calls, one to one calls, or it is, you literally like an agency call where we are running your ads and we are hopping on a call with you to show you the results and show you the next steps. Okay?\n\nNow, even if you have some of these pieces set up correctly. Okay? Just optimizing one of these deliverables in your business could significantly scale you. So if you don't have your pre cool nurturing sequences set up right, we can come in and help that help you set that up correctly.\n\nYou're gonna scale way faster. If you don't have a good BSL, we're gonna be able to come in and audit that and then scale that a a lot more effectively. If you don't have the right ads management systems, if you don't ever have the right placement exclusions, CBO versus ABO setup, whatever it is, if we optimize that, you're gonna be able to scale much faster. Okay?\n\nNow we wanna have multiple options so that we can serve you most effectively. Okay? Some of you watching this will be very busy and rich, and you wanna just have us do all this for you and and build out a paid ads funnel. That's totally cool when you can focus on what you wanna focus on.\n\nHowever, some of you are watching this will be curious about how this all works, how paid ads work for agencies, the back end, all of that good stuff, and you want us, to do it yourself, have us guide you through it, okay, with our expertise and experience so that you can learn how to run ads completely by yourself. Either way, we can help you. I would have scaled genuinely so much faster with my agency had I mastered paid ads sooner. Okay?\n\nThis is not an optional skill in my opinion in twenty twenty six. This is something that you need to learn if you wanna get out of the fifty to a hundred k a month or twenty five to a hundred k a month prison. So if you'd like to know the exact price of these different these three different service options and you wanna get a more personalized understanding for how ads would specifically work for your agency, whether you're selling SEO or, paid ads or AI, you're in ecom or or b to b or whatever it is, then I encourage you to book a call with me today by applying or booking somewhere on this page below.\n\nAnd I will one to one literally walk you through this whole system, answer any questions that you have, and we'll see if you're a right fit to, work with my company and, and go from there. Alright. Thank you very much for watching. I'm hoping that I will see you on the call soon.\n\nHappy New Year.","hasPart":[{"@type":"Clip","endOffset":90,"name":"Intro","startOffset":0,"url":"https://try.advertisingco.com/page_231rh7/?wtime=0s"},{"@type":"Clip","endOffset":109,"name":"Scaling My Agency To $1.5M/yr","startOffset":90,"url":"https://try.advertisingco.com/page_231rh7/?wtime=90s"},{"@type":"Clip","endOffset":251,"name":"Click Here If You Haven't Run Paid Ads Before","startOffset":109,"url":"https://try.advertisingco.com/page_231rh7/?wtime=109s"},{"@type":"Clip","endOffset":335,"name":"Click Here If You Are Running Paid Ads","startOffset":251,"url":"https://try.advertisingco.com/page_231rh7/?wtime=251s"},{"@type":"Clip","endOffset":541,"name":"Our Meta Ads Powered \"LTV Funnel\" ","startOffset":335,"url":"https://try.advertisingco.com/page_231rh7/?wtime=335s"},{"@type":"Clip","endOffset":641,"name":"Why You Need To Run Ads Differently As An Agency","startOffset":541,"url":"https://try.advertisingco.com/page_231rh7/?wtime=541s"},{"@type":"Clip","endOffset":737,"name":"Why This System Works So Well","startOffset":641,"url":"https://try.advertisingco.com/page_231rh7/?wtime=641s"},{"@type":"Clip","endOffset":782,"name":"Questions You May Have","startOffset":737,"url":"https://try.advertisingco.com/page_231rh7/?wtime=737s"},{"@type":"Clip","endOffset":890,"name":"Our Offer Breakdown","startOffset":782,"url":"https://try.advertisingco.com/page_231rh7/?wtime=782s"},{"@type":"Clip","endOffset":951,"name":"Why This Offer Makes Sense","startOffset":890,"url":"https://try.advertisingco.com/page_231rh7/?wtime=890s"},{"@type":"Clip","endOffset":994,"name":"Book a Call","startOffset":951,"url":"https://try.advertisingco.com/page_231rh7/?wtime=951s"}]}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_291">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/ak9z8bzr3y","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT1M13S","name":"Why This Resource Is Different","thumbnailUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/84a96c449568eae18c998a149fc5b85e3b61d8dc.jpg?image_crop_resized=960x540","embedUrl":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/ak9z8bzr3y","uploadDate":"2025-12-31T12:14:26.000Z","description":"a The Advertising Co. video","contentUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/bbcc520cbe3a23707668940879c539c685967c97.m3u8","transcript":"Hey, guys.
